      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an undergraduate student of Geography and History at Maynooth University, Ireland.
        My academic interests focus on Eastern Europe, with a growing emphasis on Russia and the wider
        Russian-speaking world. I am particularly interested in how history, geography, and language
        interact to shape identity and politics in this region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside my studies, I am actively involved in student leadership and societies, including the
        Maynooth Historical Society and the Students' Union. My long-term goal is to work as a
        Polish–English–Russian translator and interpreter, bridging communication across cultures.
      </p>

    <section id="research">
      <h2>Research & Academic Interests</h2>
      <p>
        My work explores the intersection of history, geography, and language in Eastern Europe, especially in
        relation to Russia. Key themes I am interested in include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Historical geography of the former Soviet Union</li>
        <li>Memory, identity, and historical narratives in Poland and Russia</li>
        <li>Geopolitics and regional development in the Russian Federation</li>
        <li>Comparative perspectives on Slavic cultures and languages</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As my Russian improves, I aim to work directly with Russian-language primary sources and scholarship to
        deepen this research.
      </p>

      <h2>My Russian Language Journey</h2>
      <p>
        I began learning Russian at A1 level with the goal of integrating it into both my academic work and my
        future career in translation and interpreting. As a native Polish speaker and fluent English speaker,
        I am particularly interested in the connections and contrasts between Slavic and non-Slavic languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Current Focus:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Building a solid A2 foundation in grammar and core vocabulary</li>
        <li>Daily self-study combining textbooks, online courses, and listening practice</li>
        <li>Language exchange with native Russian speakers</li>
        <li>Preparing for TORFL A2/B1 certification</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the future, I hope to study Russian language and culture at Moscow State University and reach B2 level,
        enabling me to use Russian confidently in academic and professional contexts.

      <h2>Projects & Publications</h2>
      <p>
        This section will showcase my research projects and writing related to Russia and Eastern Europe as they
        develop. Planned work includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Working Project:</strong> Historical geography of Eastern Europe after 1945, with a focus on
          shifting borders and memory in Poland and Russia.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Essay Idea:</strong> Comparative perspectives on how history is taught and remembered in Poland
          and Russia.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As I complete essays and research outputs, I will upload summaries and selected texts here.
      </p>

    <section id="teaching">
      <h2>Teaching & Translation Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I currently teach English to Polish-speaking learners, which involves explaining grammar, vocabulary,
        and reading comprehension in both languages. This experience has strengthened my ability to switch between
        languages clearly and accurately.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also completed introductory courses in interpreting and remote interpreting, which provide a
        foundation for future work in professional language services. As my Russian progresses, I plan to extend
        this experience into Polish–English–Russian translation and interpreting.
